# Whirling Triangle Feature Extraction Method

## Overview
The **Whirling Triangle Feature Extraction Method** is a geometric–computational framework that performs rotational triangular partitioning and extracts structured features from each generated region.

This method is designed to model spatial complexity using whirling (rotating) triangle formations and convert geometric structures into machine-learning-ready datasets.

The project integrates computational geometry, spatial analytics, and feature engineering into a reproducible research pipeline.
